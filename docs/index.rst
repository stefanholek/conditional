   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

.. module:: conditional
.. highlight:: python

The :class:`~conditional.conditional` context manager comes handy when you
always want to execute a with-block but only conditionally want to apply its
context manager.

If you find yourself writing code like this:

.. code-block:: python

    if CONDITION:
        with CONTEXTMANAGER():
            BODY()
    else:
        BODY()

Consider replacing it with:

.. code-block:: python

    with conditional(CONDITION, CONTEXTMANAGER()):
        BODY()

API Documentation
=================

.. function:: conditional(condition, contextmanager)

    Wrap a context manager and enter it only if condition is true.
