Conditionally enter a context manager

Package Contents
================

conditional(condition, contextmanager)
    Enter contextmanager only if condition is true.

Overview
========

The `conditional` context manager comes handy when you always want to
execute a with-block but only conditionally want to apply its context
manager.

If you find yourself writing code like this:

.. code-block:: python

    if CONDITION:
        with CONTEXTMANAGER():
            BODY()
    else:
        BODY()

Consider replacing it with:

.. code-block:: python

    with conditional(CONDITION, CONTEXTMANAGER()):
        BODY()

Async
=====

`conditional` supports asynchronous context managers:

.. code-block:: python

    async with conditional(CONDITION, ASYNCCONTEXTMANAGER()):
        BODY()

Typing
======

The package ships with type annotations. Type checkers and IDEs can
use this information to implement type safety and auto completion.

Examples
========

Say we want to ignore signals when a pager application is in the
foreground, but not otherwise:

.. code-block:: python

    from conditional import conditional

    with conditional(has_pager(cmd), ignoresignals()):
        os.system(cmd)
